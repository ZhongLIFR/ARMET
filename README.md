# ARMET

This repository contains the code for the manuscript "Cross-Domain Graph Level Anomaly Detection", which has been accpeted by TKDE for publication. The code will be updated soon to our newest version.

Readers can follow these steps to use our code:

## Step0: Check requirements
Please ensure that you have the specified environment, which is described in requirements.yml

## Step1: Download Dataset
Please download the dataset "Data.zip" from this link: [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8246213), and put them under the root_path (namely where all python scripts are located) with a name "Data". If the downloaded zip file has a name other than "Data" after unziping it, you should change it to "Data".  

## Step2: Testing

Please run main.py 

Kind note: it may take several weeks (or even several months) to get the full experiment results depending on your computational resources.
