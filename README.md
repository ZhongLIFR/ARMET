# ARMET

This repository contains the code for the manuscript "Cross-Domain Graph Level Anomaly Detection", which has been submitted to AAAI 2024.

Readers can follow these steps to use our code:

## Step0: Check requirements
Please ensure that you have the specified environment, which is described in requirements.yml

## Step1: Download Dataset
Please download the dataset "Data.zip" from this link: [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7771548), and put them under the root_path (namely where all python scripts are located) with a name "Data". If the downloaded zip file has a name other than "Data" after unziping it, you should change it to "Data".  

## Step2: Testing

Please run main.py 

Kind note: it may take several weeks (or even several months) to get the full experiment results depending on your computational resources.
